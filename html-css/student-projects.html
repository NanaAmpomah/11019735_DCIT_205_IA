          <div>Project:DEVELOPING A MOBILE INTERFACE FOR UNIVERSITY OF GHANA STUDENTS' MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM</div>
          <p>Abstract:This project is about the design and development of a mobile phone application software that would serve as a miniature form of the University of Ghana students' Management Information System (MIS). With this, students can request and receive examination results, examination time table, register semester courses, view registered courses, and query financial status by sending predefined query syntax to a short code. The waterfall process model was used. The project was divided into three phrases: mobile interface, web handler, and database development. The mobile interface is used to send all queries and the web handler for processing the query by accessing a database for results and giving a reply to the sender. The mobile interface was developed with java programming language for java Micro Edition platform using Mobile Information Device Profile 1.1 (MIDP 1.1) on Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC). The web handler was developed on the ASP NET web development platform using C# programming language. The database was implemented in MySQL using InnoDB as the engine. At the end, the phrases were integrated. The web handler successfully processed and replied all queries from the mobile interface.

          <div>Project:AN INTEGRATED ASSETS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (Transportation Module) FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA</div>
          <p> Abstract:The Integrated Assets Management System is a system that has been developed to manage the activities of the transport section of the Physical Development and Municipal Services Directorate (PDMSD) of the University of Ghana. This system provides the platform for the transport section to keep records on activities of the staff, schedule of vehicles including servicing, maintenance records, and insurance schedules. It also allows users or staff of the university to make requests of vehicles as well as track their requests. To develop the system, the business or operational process of vehicle scheduling to users, tracking, maintenance, and request procedures at the PDMSD was studied and modeled. The system was developed using a three-tier architecture: database, web application, and client which comprise the user request forms and other application forms. A PHP scripting was employed to connect the GUI and the database. The system was tested and yielded expected results.</p>

          <div>Project:DEVELOPMENT OF A TIMETABLE SCHEDULING SYSTEM FOR UNIVERSITY OF GHANA</div>
          <p>Abstract:Construction of teaching timetable and lecture hall scheduling for teaching and examinations are among the most difficult operations in educational planning. This project seeks to develop an automated software based timetable scheduler for the University of Ghana for generating timetables for lectures and examinations taking into consideration the class size and space capacity. To develop the system, the operational process of a typical timetable development for scheduling of courses and venue were studied and modeled.  The timetable system was developed using a three-tier architecture: administrator module responsible for assigning the needed information to a database, a centralised database module responsible sorting the information, and client module responsible for the actual timetabling task. The scheduling operation was based on a simple mathematical process and a look-up table rather than using a linear optimization programming. The performance of the developed system was tested using the available courses, seating capacity of lecture spaces, and Lecturers for the courses at the Department of Computer Engineering and also the Faculty of Engineering. The system was able to generate timetable without any clashes and utilized spaces in an optimal way. Further, the system was able to detect an already assigned or scheduled time slot for a course and name of Lecturer denied access to such space. The system was also used to generate a sample examination timetable which gave expected results.</p>

           <div>Project:AN ONLINE TRANSPORT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR SHUTTLE SERVICES ON THE UNIVERSITY OF GHANA, LEGON, CAMPUS.</div>
           <p>Abstract:The proposed online campus shuttles information system is a web-based information system designed to give timely and accurate information about the shuttle services on the campus of the University of Ghana. The shuttles include the Legon campus shuttles, the Metro Mass Transport buses provided by the government and some buses of the hostels around the campus. The main aim of putting the services of the buses on the Web is to grant users access to information about these services in an unrestricted manner. These users include students, lecturers, non-teaching staff, workers of the University and also outsiders. The users will have knowledge of the availability of the buses, the arrival times of the buses, the routes the buses use and regular updates of the condition of the various buses and the roads The database was implemented using MySQL in the XAMPP package. The XAMPP come with the Apache as the server. PHP programming language was used at the server side. The client side was designed and developed to be user friendly interface with information to guide the user as he or she surfs about on the software. The Dreamweaver was used at the client side for the development. After the development of the online transportation information system, it was successfully tested and it gave positive output with little time lapses. But a lot could be done in other aspects to improve the software, like the inclusion of a GPS system which could track the exact location of the various buses on campus.</p>

            <div>Project:DEVELOPING A WEB-BASED SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM</div>
           <p>Abstract:In our world today, the development of video surveillance systems is growing fast and as such IP based solutions are growing at a tremendous speed. A lot of manufacturers are coming out with a wide range of IP video cameras and video servers for the purpose of IP enabled video system that can be used at both the domestic and professional level to monitor homes, schools, offices, hospitals, or any place where surveillance is required. The system generally is made up of two main parts which are the server side and the client side. At the server side an application code that supports the camera was developed using the visual C# programming language, and MySQL was used to build a centralised database that holds information on the users of the system and the streamed video files as well as the archives. At the client side is the graphical User Interface (GUI) which was developed using the HTML and PHP. The camera server has features such as select camera where the camera to be used for the streaming is selected because this server actually supports more than one camera. The “save to folder” feature helps to select where the videos being streamed are to be saved, the “stream to file “determines the format of the streamed video, the “streaming port” is what provides connection at the user’s end, the maximum connections enable the selection of the number of clients to access the system, and finally, the start and stop buttons starts and ends the camera respectively. The video is then streamed live via the internet after which the video files can be saved onto the hard disk by means of the MySQL connector which is a NET platform. The platform on which this system was built is the Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition (5.1, Build 2600). </p>

            <div>Project:AN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR THE SECURITY SERVICE OF UNIVERSITY OF GHANA </div>
            <p>Abstract:This project is aimed at developing a web-based management information system for the security service unit of the University of Ghana to aid the security service to carry out the management of the daily scheduling and reporting routine of the unit. To execute the project, the operation logic of the security services unit and the procedures for staff scheduling and reporting as well as requests procedures from the university community were studied and modeled. The system development was structured into three layers namely: Client (front end), Application (middle), and Database (back-end) system architecture. The development was done using a centralised relational database management system – MySQL to store all data within the security service unit, Apache web server for the communication over the web, and a user friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) client-end which was developed using HTML, PHP and CSS to access the database. The performance of the system was tested and expected results were obtained. Security personnel of the university were scheduled to the various security stations on campus and reports were created directly for the immediate viewing by the chief security officer and any other authorized officer of the university. The system also provides opportunity for members of the university community to report of any observed crisis on campus for attention and also tracks the requests. </p>
